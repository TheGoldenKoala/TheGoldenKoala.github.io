Hello World! This is my first post here and welcome! Join me and let us see where this goes. Who knows. Life is like a box of chocolates... You never really know what your gonna get.
I don't have much to say except that I want to get this going, I am super excited and energized to be posting on here. I don't really know too much about coding. Maybe this wasn't the best
platform to use to make a website. It's okay for now, maybe i'll learn some coding to be able to customize my website more. Anyways super excited.
 ```tsql
 SELECT *
 FROM sys.tables
 WHERE [name] = 'SomeTable'
 ```
