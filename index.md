Hello everyone and welcome to my world. This website is meant to be an outlet for me and all my thoughts. I wanted to create a place where I can share my ideas and passions to people all over the world and hoepfully my posts will resonate with someone out there.
There are alot of things that I am interested in. I love running, singing, and playing soccer. There will be many more things that I will post on here and maybe it will be completely different from the last thing that I posted but that is okay. I do not want to be too serious when creating this website. I am not trying to make any money off this.
One of the things that I feel is most important when creating this platform is that I want to be as honest as possible to you but also honest to myself. I want to be able to talk about fun stuff and also stuff that is hard to talk about as well.
I hope in my posts that I will be able to inspire others and inform others through my interests and opinions. I wish you to join me along on this ride.
